# AdventOfCode2021

Repository for the AoC2021.

I use an utility file, written while solving previous AoCs, which can be found at AoCLibraries/AoCUtils.

Solutions are in the corresponding day, part{n}.py is the code and output{n}.txt is the solution.
Input is read from input.txt, and when necessary (for debug or visualisation purposes) there is a separate file
called log{n}.txt

To create the folder for day n, use the bash script "make_folder n"

To run the solution for day n part k, use "run_solution n k".
